# KG course
This is great ODS [course track](https://migalkin.github.io/kgcourse2021/) about knowledge grpahs in Russian language provided in general by ITMO university.
Many of materials and hometasks are just a translation of Stanford Courses (like [cs224w](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/)), and I am proud of having an
opportunity to work with these great materials on my mother language.

As I will have finished the tasks, there will be an outline.
